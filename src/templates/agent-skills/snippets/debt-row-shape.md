**Debt row fields.** One shape for every producer of a
`## Specification Debt` row — clarification candidates, refinement findings,
and plan-review findings alike:

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `Impact` | One of `Critical` / `High` / `Medium` / `Low`. |
| `Confidence` | One of `High` / `Medium` / `Low`. |
| `Title` | A slug of 40 characters or fewer naming the unresolved choice. Not a sentence — the statement goes in the item's detail section. |
| `Source Category` | The scan or audit category that produced the item. Findings from a review agent use `plan-review:<finding category>` (e.g. `plan-review:Internal contradiction`). |
| `Origin` | `local` for an item discovered in the artifact being authored, or `<parent-kind>:SD-NNN` for one carried down from a parent artifact. |

`Important` is **not** a valid `Impact` value. A review finding's severity is
`Critical` / `Important` / `Minor`, which is a different scale, so map it into
`Impact` rather than copying it: `Critical` stays `Critical` and `Important`
becomes `High`. `Minor` never reaches the debt table, so it never maps.

A review finding's `confidence` is the `High` / `Low` decision of whether the
parent may apply the fix — the two endpoints of the same scale, so it copies
into the `Confidence` column unchanged. `Medium` is produced only by
clarification and refinement, which grade a recommended answer rather than an
auto-apply decision.
