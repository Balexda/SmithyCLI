**Resolving the project.** Engraved knowledge is partitioned into `user`,
`repo`, and `project` levels; the project level is only in play when a project
is named. Resolve it in this order and stop at the first hit:

1. An explicit `--project <slug>` token in the invoking arguments.
2. A `project:` field in the frontmatter or header block of the planning
   artifact being worked on.
3. Exactly one directory under `~/.smithy/projects/` other than `default`.

If none of those resolve, or more than one candidate remains at step 3, there
is **no** project level for this run: say so rather than guessing. Never infer
a project from the working directory name.
