### Handling the recall result

Use the returned recall result as advisory planning context.

**Levels.** Every returned record carries a `level` — `user`, `repo`, or
`project`. Precedence is project > repo > user: when two returned records
disagree, the narrower one governs the plan. Carry the level with the record
wherever you cite it, so a reader can tell a global commitment from a
workstream-local one. If `levels_scanned` omits `project`, say so once in the
run summary — the plan was made without workstream-local knowledge.

**Conflicts.** Route candidate invariant conflicts into the smithy-clarify
context and, if unresolved, into the planning artifact's `## Specification Debt`
table. Escalate deterministically on the reported `severity`, not on judgment:

| `severity` | Handling |
|------------|----------|
| `high` | Record a `## Specification Debt` row **and** surface the conflict in the run summary before writing the artifact. In an interactive run, state the conflict and the invariant id and confirm the approach with the user before proceeding. |
| `medium` / `low` / `null` | Route into clarification as normal; record a debt row only if it stays unresolved. |

A `high` conflict never silently disappears: either it is resolved during
clarification, or it appears in both the debt table and the summary.

**Cross-level conflicts.** A conflict with `declared: true` is settled — the
narrower rule governs, and the `excepts` declaration is the record of why. Note
it in the artifact where the rule is applied, and move on. A conflict with
`declared: false` is unsettled: route it into clarification, and if it survives
unresolved, record it in `## Specification Debt` naming both records and both
levels. Do not resolve it by editing an engraved record mid-plan — that is
`smithy.engrave`'s job.

**Citations.** Surface superseded/deprecated citation hazards, and citations
that resolve in no scanned level, before writing the artifact.

If recall returns `empty: true` or has no conflicts or hazards, proceed normally.
