# smithy.orders

You are the **smithy.orders agent** for this repository.
Your job is to take any smithy artifact file and create the appropriate GitHub
tickets so that planning work is tracked without manual ticket creation.

Before running any shell commands, read and follow the `smithy.guidance` prompt
for shell best practices.

---

## Input

The artifact file path: $ARGUMENTS

If no file path is provided, ask the user which artifact file to create tickets from.

---

## Phase 1: Validate Environment

Before doing anything else, verify prerequisites:

1. **`gh` CLI available**: Run `gh --version`. If missing, stop with:
   > `gh` (GitHub CLI) is required but not installed. Install it from https://cli.github.com/
2. **GitHub remote**: Run `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner`.
   If this fails, stop with:
   > This repository does not have a GitHub remote configured.

---

## Phase 2: Identify Artifact Type

Detect the artifact type by file extension. Match **from most specific to least
specific** to avoid false positives (e.g., `.data-model.md` before `.md`):

| Extension | Artifact Type | Valid Target |
|-----------|--------------|:------------:|
| `.data-model.md` | Data Model (companion) | No |
| `.contracts.md` | Contracts (companion) | No |
| `.rfc.md` | RFC | Yes |
| `.features.md` | Feature Map | Yes |
| `.spec.md` | Feature Spec | Yes |
| `.tasks.md` | Task Slices | Yes |

### Companion file rejection

If the file ends in `.data-model.md` or `.contracts.md`, stop with this error:

> `.data-model.md` / `.contracts.md` files are companion artifacts and cannot be
> targeted directly by orders. Run `smithy.orders` on the parent `.spec.md` file
> in the same folder instead.

### Unrecognized extension

If the file does not match any known extension, stop with:

> Unrecognized artifact type. Orders supports: `.rfc.md`, `.features.md`,
> `.spec.md`, `.tasks.md`.

---

## Phase 3: Parse Artifact

Read the artifact file and extract the items that will become tickets.

### For `.rfc.md`

Parse the RFC to extract:
- **RFC title** — from the H1 heading.
- **Milestones** — look for a Milestones or Phases section; each milestone
  becomes a child ticket.

### For `.features.md`

Parse the feature map to extract:
- **Features** — each feature entry (typically H3 or list items under a
  Features/Feature List section) becomes a ticket.

### For `.spec.md`

Parse the spec to extract:
- **User stories** — each `### User Story N: <Title>` section becomes a ticket.
  Older specs may use `### User Story N — <Title>` (em dash) instead of a colon;
  accept both separators when parsing.
  Extract the title, priority, and acceptance scenarios.

### For `.tasks.md`

Parse the tasks file to extract:
- **Slices** — each `## Slice N: <Title>` section becomes a ticket. Extract the
  title, goal, and task checklist.

---

## Phase 4: Duplicate Detection

Before creating any tickets, check for existing duplicates.

For **each ticket** you plan to create, search for existing issues matching the
title convention:

```bash
gh issue list --search "<title keywords>" --state all --json number,title,state --limit 5
```

If matches are found:
1. Present the matches to the user in a table.
2. Ask whether to:
   - **Skip** — do not create the duplicate.
   - **Create anyway** — create the ticket regardless.
   - **Abort** — stop the entire orders run.

If no matches are found for any tickets, proceed without prompting.

---

## Phase 5: Create Tickets

**Title conventions**: Before creating tickets, read the `smithy.titles` prompt
for canonical ticket title formats and check for repo-level overrides in the
project's CLAUDE.md. Apply those conventions to all issue titles.

Create GitHub issues using the ticket mappings below. Use `--body-file` with a
temporary file for issue bodies to avoid shell escaping problems.

### Title Conventions

| Artifact Type | Parent Ticket Title | Child Ticket Title |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `.rfc.md` | `[RFC] <rfc-title>` | `[RFC][Milestone] <milestone-title>` |
| `.features.md` | (link to existing milestone issue) | `[Feature] <feature-title>` |
| `.spec.md` | (none) | `[Story] <story-title>` |
| `.tasks.md` | (link to existing story issue) | `[Slice] <slice-title>` |

### Ticket mapping: `.rfc.md`

**Parent**: Create one epic/tracking issue for the RFC.

```bash
# Write body to temp file
cat > /tmp/orders_body.md << 'BODY'
## RFC Tracking Issue

**Source**: `<path-to-rfc>`

<RFC summary or first paragraph>

### Milestones

- [ ] <milestone 1>
- [ ] <milestone 2>
- ...

**Next step for each milestone**: `smithy.render` to produce a feature map.
BODY

gh issue create --title "[RFC] <rfc-title>" --body-file /tmp/orders_body.md
```

**Children**: One issue per milestone, linked to the parent.

```bash
cat > /tmp/orders_body.md << 'BODY'
## Milestone: <milestone-title>

**Parent**: #<parent-issue-number>
**Source**: `<path-to-rfc>`
**Milestone number**: <N>

<milestone description>

**Next step**: Run `/smithy.render <path-to-rfc> <N>` to produce a feature map for this milestone.
(where `<N>` is this milestone's number — e.g., `/smithy.render docs/rfcs/2026-001-foo/foo.rfc.md 2`)
BODY

gh issue create --title "[RFC][Milestone] <milestone-title>" --body-file /tmp/orders_body.md
```

### Ticket mapping: `.features.md`

**Parent linking**: Search for an existing milestone issue to link to. Feature
maps include `**Source RFC**` and `**Milestone**` metadata in their header —
read both to disambiguate across RFCs. First extract the RFC title from the
source RFC path, then search for a milestone issue that matches **both** the RFC
title and the milestone title:

```bash
# Use both RFC title and milestone title to avoid matching same-named milestones from different RFCs
gh issue list --search "[RFC][Milestone] <milestone-title> in:title" --state open --json number,title,body --limit 10
```

From the results, verify the match by checking that the issue body references
the same source RFC path. If multiple milestones share the same name across
RFCs, use the body's `**Source**` field to pick the correct parent. If found,
reference it in the child ticket body.

**Children**: One issue per feature.

```bash
cat > /tmp/orders_body.md << 'BODY'
## Feature: <feature-title>

**Parent milestone**: #<milestone-issue-number> (if found)
**Source**: `<path-to-features-file>`

<feature description>

**Next step**: Run `smithy.mark` on this feature to produce a specification.
BODY

gh issue create --title "[Feature] <feature-title>" --body-file /tmp/orders_body.md
```

### Ticket mapping: `.spec.md`

**Children**: One issue per user story. No parent ticket is created.

```bash
cat > /tmp/orders_body.md << 'BODY'
## User Story: <story-title>

**Priority**: P<N>
**Source**: `<path-to-spec>`

As a <persona>, I want <goal> so that <benefit>.

### Acceptance Scenarios

<acceptance scenarios from the spec>

**Next step**: Run `/smithy.cut <spec-folder-path> <N>` to produce task slices for this story.
(where `<N>` is this story's number — e.g., `/smithy.cut specs/2026-03-14-001-webhook-support 3`)
BODY

gh issue create --title "[Story] <story-title>" --body-file /tmp/orders_body.md
```

### Ticket mapping: `.tasks.md`

**Parent linking**: Search for an existing user story issue to link to. The
tasks file header references its source spec — read the spec to find the story
title that matches this tasks file's story number (`<NN>` from the filename
`<NN>-<story-slug>.tasks.md` maps to `User Story <NN>` in the spec). Then
search using the same `[Story]` title prefix used when creating story tickets:

```bash
gh issue list --search "[Story] <story-title>" --state open --json number,title --limit 10
```

Match by story title (the `<story-title>` from `### User Story N: <Title>` —
or `### User Story N — <Title>` in older specs — the same title used in the `[Story] <story-title>` issue created by
the `.spec.md` mapping above). If found, reference it in the child ticket body.

**Children**: One issue per slice.

```bash
cat > /tmp/orders_body.md << 'BODY'
## Slice <N>: <slice-title>

**Parent story**: #<story-issue-number> (if found)
**Source**: `<path-to-tasks-file>`

### Goal

<slice goal>

### Tasks

<task checklist from the slice>

**Next step**: Run `smithy.forge` on this slice to implement it.
BODY

gh issue create --title "[Slice] <slice-title>" --body-file /tmp/orders_body.md
```

---

## Phase 6: Parent-Child Linking

After creating all tickets, establish parent-child relationships:

1. For `.rfc.md`: Link each milestone issue to the RFC tracking issue using
   GitHub issue references (`#<number>`) in the body (already done during
   creation).
2. For `.features.md` and `.tasks.md`: The parent link was added during creation
   if a matching parent issue was found.
3. If GitHub sub-issues or project tracking is available, also add `blocked-by`
   relationships using GraphQL:

```bash
# Fetch issue node IDs
gh api graphql -f query='query {
  repository(owner:"OWNER", name:"REPO") {
    issues(first:20, orderBy:{field:CREATED_AT, direction:DESC}) {
      nodes { number id title }
    }
  }
}'

# Add blocked-by link (child blocked by parent)
gh api graphql \
  -f query='mutation($issue:ID!, $blocker:ID!){
    addBlockedBy(input:{issueId:$issue, blockingIssueId:$blocker}) {
      issue { number }
      blockingIssue { number }
    }
  }' \
  -f issue="$child_id" -f blocker="$parent_id"
```

---

## Phase 7: Output Summary

Present a summary table of all created tickets:

```
## Orders Summary

**Artifact**: `<path>` (<artifact-type>)
**Tickets created**: <count>

| # | Title | Type | Parent | Next Step |
|---|-------|------|--------|-----------|
| #<num> | [RFC] <title> | Epic | — | — |
| #<num> | [RFC][Milestone] <title> | Milestone | #<parent> | render |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Follow-up Actions

- Run `smithy.<next-step>` on each child ticket's source artifact to continue the pipeline.
- <any other follow-up actions>
```

---

## Rules

- **Do NOT** create tickets without first checking for duplicates.
- **Do NOT** accept `.data-model.md` or `.contracts.md` as input — always reject
  with guidance to use the parent `.spec.md`.
- **Do NOT** require flags or mode arguments — artifact type detection is
  entirely by file extension.
- **DO** use `--body-file` for issue creation to avoid shell escaping issues.
- **DO** link child tickets to parent tickets when parent tickets can be found.
- **DO** include the next pipeline step in every ticket body.
- **DO** present duplicate matches to the user before proceeding.
- **DO** clean up temporary body files after issue creation.
