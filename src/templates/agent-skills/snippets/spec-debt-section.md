## Specification Debt
<!-- audience: reviewer; mode: reference; length: index table + 1-3 sentences per item; diagram: optional; examples: discouraged -->

| ID | Title | Source Category | Impact | Confidence | Origin |
|----|-------|-----------------|--------|------------|--------|
| SD-001 | <slug naming the unresolved choice> | <clarify scan category> | High | Medium | local |
| SD-002 | <slug of a carried-down item> | <clarify scan category> | Medium | Medium | spec:SD-002 |

### SD-001 — <Title>

<The unresolved choice, stated as an open question or as "unresolved choice
between X and Y". Name the alternatives and what each one would imply. 1-3
sentences. Never a directive.>

### Resolved

#### SD-000 — <Title>

**Question:** <the open question this item recorded>

**Answer:** <what was decided, on what basis, and when.>

_`Title` is a short slug (40 characters or fewer) — the full statement lives in
the item's detail section, never in the table. Emit one `### SD-NNN — <Title>`
detail section for every row whose `Origin` is `local`; rows carried down from a
parent artifact get an index row only, because their prose lives in the parent.
Never put an unescaped `|` in a table cell — pipes belong in detail prose. Omit
the `### Resolved` subsection entirely when nothing has been resolved. If there
are no debt items at all, replace this whole section body with:
"None — no specification debt was recorded."_
