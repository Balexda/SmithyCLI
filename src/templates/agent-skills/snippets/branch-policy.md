## Branch Selection Policy

Apply this check before any auto-naming branch step in the parent phase,
and again at the commit-and-PR step. It exists so `smithy.<verb>` is safe
to invoke from a pre-existing checkout on a non-default branch —
orchestrators that pre-create a linked git worktree on a known branch and
hand it to a Claude Code worker rely on the agent honoring the checkout
rather than renaming it. The same `smithy.<verb>` invoked the normal way
(in the main checkout, after `mark` / `cut` set up a branch) must still
auto-create its own branch as before.

### Detect the default branch

1. First try the cheap form:

   ```bash
   git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
   ```

   On success it prints a single line like `refs/remotes/origin/main`;
   strip the `refs/remotes/origin/` prefix to get the default branch
   name. Do not assume `main`. (Note: do **not** add the `--short` flag —
   the bare form is what the repo's auto-allow list permits, and the
   prefix is easy to strip.)

2. If that command exits non-zero with `not a symbolic ref` (common in
   fresh clones, mirrors, and some linked worktrees where `origin/HEAD`
   was never set), fall back to:

   ```bash
   git remote show origin
   ```

   Find the line `  HEAD branch: <name>` in the output and use `<name>`.

3. If both fail, ask the user which branch is the default and proceed
   from their answer rather than guessing.

### Detect the worktree shape

Determine whether the current working directory is the **main checkout**
or a **linked worktree**:

```bash
git rev-parse --git-dir
git rev-parse --git-common-dir
```

- If the two paths are equal, the current cwd is the **main checkout**.
- If they differ (the `--git-dir` path lives under
  `<common>/worktrees/<name>`), the current cwd is a **linked worktree**
  — typically created by `git worktree add` or by an upstream
  orchestrator that pre-staged it for an agent run.

### Detect the current branch

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

### Decide

- **If the current branch is not the default branch AND the current cwd
  is a linked worktree**, keep the existing branch. Skip the parent
  phase's auto-naming step, do not run `git checkout -b`, and do not
  prepend `feature/` or any other prefix when later pushing or opening
  the PR. The orchestrator already chose this branch and tracks the work
  by that exact name.
- **Otherwise** (the cwd is the main checkout, or the current branch is
  already the default branch), run the parent phase's auto-naming step
  (`git checkout -b <derived-name>`). The main-checkout case is the
  greenfield path *and* the normal `mark` → `cut` → `forge` flow —
  forge, for example, must continue to auto-create its per-slice branch
  even when the user invoked it while still sitting on the spec branch
  that `mark` created.

Confirm the resolved branch name to the user and proceed.

### PR step

The same rule applies during the commit-and-PR step: push the resolved
branch as-is, and pass it as the PR's head when the chosen PR-creation
tool requires it (e.g. the `head` argument for the GitHub MCP tool, or
the equivalent flag on the CLI fallback — see the
`pr-create-tool-choice` snippet for which tool to prefer). **Never
create a new branch or rename the current one as part of the PR-creation
command** (in particular, do not prepend `feature/` to the resolved
branch). The branch the agent commits and pushes from must be the same
branch the resulting PR is opened against. This rule applies in both
the main checkout and a linked worktree — branch renames during PR
creation are always wrong.
